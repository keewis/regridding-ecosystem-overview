A regular grid with constant-sized grids.

Rectilinear grids arrange the sampling points along lines along the coordinate axes of a projection, forming rectangular cells. This allows us to describe the grid using 1D coordinates.

If the distance between the points is constant along both coordinate axes, the grid is called "regular".

The simplest and by far most commonly used grid is a regular longitude / latitude grid, i.e. a regular grid following the equirectangular projection.
